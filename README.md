# Building a Student Database

*Learning Documentation*

This project was developed as part of the "Learn `SQL` by Building a Student Database: Part 1 and Part 2" courses, which are part of the [Relational Database certification from FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/).

## Roadmap

Here's a quick overview of the process followed in this course:

1. Created a database using `PostgreSQL` using the `command line`.
2. Developed a `bash script` to automate the process of inserting data into the database.
3. Developed another `bash script` for querying the database.

The detailed explanation of each step is provided in the following sections.

## Part 1: Building the Database

In the first part of the course, I learned how to build a database using the `command line` in `PostgreSQL`. This part of the course consisted of **140 lessons**, each one contributing to my understanding of `SQL` and database management.

In addition to building the database, I also created a bash `script` to automate the process of inserting data into the database. This allowed me to practice and reinforce my understanding of both `SQL` and `bash` scripting.

## Part 2: Querying the Database

The second part of the course focused on querying the database that was built in Part 1. I created another `bash script`, this time for querying the database.

I learned how to perform both simple and complex queries, which has given me a solid foundation in `SQL` and will be invaluable in my future projects.

This diagram provides a visual representation of the database structure, making it easier to understand the relationships between different tables and fields.

## Script Documents Analysis

The `script` documents contain the `bash` scripts used for inserting data into the database and querying the database. By analyzing these scripts, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of how `SQL` queries work and how they can be automated using `bash` scripts.

Through this project, I have gained a solid foundation in `SQL`, **database management**, and **bash scripting**. I look forward to applying these *skills* in my future projects.
